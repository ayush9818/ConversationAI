{"prompt": "Why do I need a plan?", "completion": "There are a lot of things you can't control. You can't control what happens next, how governments respond, or how your neighbours react to the pandemic. What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health. \n Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next\u2014but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can: \n Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone \n Plan out daily tasks and goals \n Give yourself a schedule to look up current information \n Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home \n Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk \n Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions \n Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routine \n Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time \n Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider \n Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community \n Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well. Problem-solving is a helpful skill no matter what else is going on in the world, and it's an empowering, methodical approach when you might otherwise feel overwhelmed or lost. \n Check out the following resources for more information about problem-solving: \n Wellness Module 4: Problem-Solving: www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-4-problem-solving \n Problem-solving worksheet from Anxiety Canada: www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/ProblemSolving.pdf \n Effective Problem-Solving in The Antidepressant Skills Workbook: psychhealthandsafety.org/asw"}
{"prompt": "How can I find help for an alcohol or drug use problem?", "completion": "Seeking to make changes in the way you use substances like alcohol or other drugs? This can be an important step! \n Some people are able to reduce their substance use or quit altogether on their own or with self-help materials. But most of us need support from other people\u2014family members, friends, health professionals, or other people struggling with substance use problems. The right help for you depends on many factors. These include the type of drug you are using, how much and how often, your health and social situation and, of course, your own preferences. Getting help doesn\u2019t mean giving up control of shaping your own path. You are still the one who makes the final decisions about the type and degree of change you make. \n One way to get help is to talk to a doctor you trust and feel comfortable confiding in. If you aren\u2019t comfortable talking in person, you can also get advice from a registered nurse (along with advice on programs or services in your area) by calling HealthLink BC at 8-1-1. Since some drugs are illegal, many people worry about what might happen if they talk about drug use. It\u2019s important to know that in most cases, doctors have to protect your privacy\u2014it\u2019s the law. \n In BC, the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service can help you find information on treatment options, support groups and other resources throughout the province. It\u2019s free, confidential, and available 24/7. Call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441 or 604-660-9382 in the Lower Mainland."}
{"prompt": "What's the difference between a psychiatrist and a registered psychologist?", "completion": "A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy (\u2018talk therapies\u2019) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor\u2019s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. \n A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don\u2019t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor\u2019s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself\u2014you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist\u2019s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes. \n You\u2019ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional\u2019s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you\u2019re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations. \n Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations \n Ask local mental health organizations for help. You can find local branches through the provincial organizations behind HeretoHelp \n Ask a community health centre, outpatient psychiatry program, or mental health team for suggestions \n For a list of psychiatrists near you, search under \u2018Specialist\u2019 in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia\u2019s Find a Physician Tool but remember that you will first need a referral from a doctor (like your family doctor) \n For a list of psychologists near you, search in the British Columbia Psychological Association\u2019s Find a Registered Psychologist tool and you can also learn more about finding a psychologist from the College of Psychologists of British Columbia"}
{"prompt": "How can I get help paying for my medication?", "completion": "Some pharmaceutical companies offer prescription assistance programs to individuals and families with financial needs, while others offer special drug discount cards. These programs typically require a doctor\u2019s consent and proof of your financial status. They may also require that you have either no health insurance or no prescription drug benefit through your health insurance.\\nIn addition, there are prescription programs you might qualify for. Visit Healthfinder.gov to learn more."}
{"prompt": "How can I see a psychiatrist?", "completion": "A psychiatrist is a specialist doctor. In BC, you need to ask your doctor for a referral. If you don't see a regular family doctor, you can ask any doctor at a walk-in clinic for a referral. \n In some cases, you may be able to \"self-refer\" or make an appointment with a mental health program yourself, but that may not get you access to a psychiatrist. Contact your local mental health centre to see what's available in your area. You can search for mental health centres at www.gov.bc.ca/mentalhealth. If you need help finding your local mental health centre, call HealthlinkBC at 811 or visit www.healthlinkbc.ca and use the Find Health Service tool."}
{"prompt": "Where else can I get help?", "completion": "Where you go for help will depend on the nature of the problem and/or symptoms and what best fits you. Often, the best place to start is by talking with someone you trust about your concerns, such as a family member, friend, clergy, healthcare provider, or other professionals. Having this social support is essential in healing from mental illness, and you will be able to ask them for referrals or recommendations for trusted mental health practitioners. Search for mental health resources in your area.\nSecondly, there are people and places throughout Nebraska that provide services to talk, to listen, and to help you on your journey to recovery. Thirdly, many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members, and friends. Some support groups are peer led while others may be led by a mental health professional."}
{"prompt": "How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?", "completion": "How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \n People often overestimate the negative parts\u2014their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself\u2014and underestimate positive parts\u2014their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \n How does the thought \"We're never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good\u2014and it isn't even true. \n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \n Here are a few example: \n \"I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \n \"I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \n \"I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \n \"I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results. \n \"I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \n \"It makes sense that I feel scared\u2014people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \n \"We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.\" \n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."}
{"prompt": "What is dysthymia or persistent depressive disorder?", "completion": "Dysthymia, now called persistent depressive disorder or PDD, is a mood disorder. It is related depression (major depressive disorder). The difference between the two is in the number of symptoms and the amount of time that they last. Someone diagnosed with PDD would experience two to four of the symptoms below for at least two years with no periods of wellness during that time, while someone diagnosed with major depressive disorder would experience five or more of the symptoms below for at least two weeks. \n Symptoms of PDD include: \n There is a myth that PDD is not as severe an illness as major depressive disorder, but research shows that the disability of the illness, like the ability to work productively and enjoy hobbies, may be as severe in PDD as it is in major depressive disorder. As PDD involves a smaller number of symptoms that last for a very long time, many people begin to assume PDD is just part of their personality rather than an illness that can be effectively treated. So you should most certainly talk to a doctor or mental health professional if you think you might have PDD."}
{"prompt": "How can I take care of my physical health?", "completion": "Taking care of your physical health is also good for your mental health. It's more important than ever to keep yourself healthy. \n Try to eat as well as you can. It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don\u2019t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables\u2014we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. \n If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. \n Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. \n If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures\u2014they're just keeping everyone safe.) \n If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. \n Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits. For more, check out Wellness Module 6: Getting a Good Night's Sleep at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-6-getting-a-good-nights-sleep. \n If you have other health problems like a chronic illness, check in with your doctor or health care team to see if you need to take any additional measures or precautions. Remember to plan ahead and do what you can to keep prescription or over-the-counter medications, medical supplies, supplements, or other health needs on hand."}
{"prompt": "I received a diagnosis but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. What can I do?", "completion": "If possible, bring up your concerns with the professional who provided the diagnosis. That way, the professional can answer your questions and you can better understand their decision. \n If that doesn\u2019t resolve the situation or a follow-up appointment isn\u2019t possible, you can ask for a second opinion. A second opinion is an assessment from a different professional. This can give you better understanding of what\u2019s going on and what to do about it. Second opinions are common when it comes to major health decisions\u2014you won\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings and your doctor will try to accommodate reasonable requests for a second opinion. Talk to your family doctor (or go to a walk-in clinic) to discuss your options and get a referral to a different program or health professional, if needed. \n For more how to get a second opinion, see HealthLinkBC\u2019s factsheet at www.healthlinkbc.ca. \n For general tips on managing a diagnosis of a mental illness and working well with health care professionals, see HeretoHelp\u2019s Managing a Mental Illness series."}
{"prompt": "Who does mental illness affect?", "completion": "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.\nAlthough mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.\nAdditionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.\nParents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."}
{"prompt": "How can I challenge thinking traps?", "completion": "What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \n Here are some common thinking traps: \n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\u2019s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \n I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \n I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. \n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \n I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \n Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \n This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \n Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: \n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \n I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! \n Labeling \n 'Should' statements \n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \n It's okay to feel upset right now\u2014there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \n Check out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking."}
{"prompt": "Where can I learn about types of mental health treatment?", "completion": "Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the two. However, there are many different types of treatment available, including Complementary & Alternative Treatments, self-help plans, and peer support. Treatments are very personal and should be discussed by the person with the mental health conditions and his or her team."}
{"prompt": "What is MSP?", "completion": "MSP stands for Medical Services Plan. It\u2019s a health insurance program managed by the government for people who live in British Columbia, Canada. MSP pays for things like doctor\u2019s appointments, appointments with specialist doctors like psychiatrists, and hospital stays you need to treat a medical problem. \n Everyone who lives in BC must enroll in MSP.

{"prompt": "If I feel better after taking medication, does this mean I am \"cured\" and can stop taking it?", "completion": "It is not uncommon for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms are under control. Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.\\nAnother problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don\u2019t occur.\\nIt is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit."}
{"prompt": "What treatment options are available?", "completion": "Just as there are different types of medications for physical illness, different treatment options are available for individuals with mental illness. Treatment works differently for different people. It is important to find what works best for you or your child."}
{"prompt": "How do I know if I'm drinking too much?", "completion": "Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated. You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique. No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different. \n Those of us who drink, seek benefits from alcohol, not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more, and more often, than makes sense. As a general rule, drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol \u201call day every day.\u201d But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem, for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired. \n What\u2019s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts (i.e., places, times and activities) and over time (e.g., coping with chronic problems). You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada\u2019s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short, simple screen can be used by people of all ages. \n All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. \n By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death, your chances for long-term health consequences such as cancer or heart disease, and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms. \n Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider. \n Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours. \n Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. \n Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time. \n Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days. \n Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcohol-related harm. \n Tip: If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options. \n For information on treatment options and resources throughout BC, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441. In Greater Vancouver, call 604-660-9382. \n To better understand how substances play a role in your life, visit the You and Substance Use workbook on the HeretoHelp website. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information.

{"prompt": "How can I tell if health information is good or bad?", "completion": "Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test. \n It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. \n Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \n Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \n Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \n Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \n Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. \n Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? \n Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. \n Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. \n Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy \n Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available) \n This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet."}

{"prompt": "What causes mental illness?", "completion": "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child\u2019s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."}
{"prompt": "If cannabis is dangerous, why are we legalizing it?", "completion": "Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

{"prompt": "How can I maintain social connections? What if I feel lonely?", "completion": "A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. \n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \n Everyone feels lonely at times\u2014maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \n Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. \n Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. \n Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone.

{"prompt": "Are there cures for mental health problems?", "completion": "It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the issues you face. Talking, counselling, medication, friendships, exercise, good sleep and nutrition, and meaningful occupation can all help."}
{"prompt": "How do I apply for income assistance?", "completion": "Provincial income assistance has three income levels: basic assistance (also called welfare), Persons with Disabilities benefits (PWD), and the Persons with Persistent and Multiple Barriers to employment benefits (PPMB). All are administered by the Ministry of Social Development and Social Inclusion. Depending on the situation, mental illness may considered under PWD or PPMB.

{"prompt": "I was prescribed an antidepressant or other psychiatric medication but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working. What can I do?", "completion": "If you\u2019re concerned about your medications, it\u2019s important to talk with the doctor or psychiatrist who prescribed your medications. While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants, it\u2019s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect. \n Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects, call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone after-hours by calling 811. \n It\u2019s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better, it\u2019s important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions. \n In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious, like a rash. In these cases, you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after-hours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing, dizziness, or confusion, call 911 right away. \n When you start a new medication, your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects, signs of an allergic reaction, how long it might take to work, and other information. It\u2019s good information to keep on hand, but it isn\u2019t always easy to read. When you pick up your medication, you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for. \n If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn\u2019t working for you, there are many different options! Unfortunately, finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication, and often you need to try something to see if it works (or doesn\u2019t work) for you. This can be a frustrating process, especially when you want to start feeling better, but it\u2019s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options. Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals, but it\u2019s important to share information so you both understand what\u2019s going on and can make good, informed decisions about your health care. Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion, but its important information for your doctor (and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns). You can find strategies, including a mood journal, to help you work with doctors and other health care providers in our Working With Your Doctor toolkit."}
{"prompt": "What is a referral?", "completion": "A referral means someone recommends you to another service. In health care, it usually means a request from your doctor to see a specialist like a psychiatrist. \n To access any specialist in BC, you first need a referral. You may need to meet certain criteria, like a specific diagnosis or specific symptoms, to access some specialists. Your doctor can tell you what to expect. \n Once your doctor has made the referral, the specialist\u2019s office will contact you with an appointment time. Make sure your doctor\u2019s office has your current contact information so the specialist can reach you. \n The process is the same whether you see the same family doctor or visit a walk-in clinic. \n Not all mental health programs in BC require a doctor\u2019s referral. This is good news for people who are looking for help! A \"self-referral\" means that you ask to see someone, and then you will be evaluated to see if you meet the criteria to receive services. Contact your local health authority to learn more about programs in your area:"}
{"prompt": "What are positive and negative symptoms?", "completion": "Positive and negative symptoms are medical terms for two groups of symptoms in schizophrenia. \n Positive symptoms add. Positive symptoms include hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real), delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t be real), and repetitive movements that are hard to control. \n Negative symptoms take away. Negative symptoms include the inability to show emotions, apathy, difficulties talking, and withdrawing from social situations and relationships. \n There is also a third group of symptoms, usually called cognitive symptoms. This includes anything related to thinking, such as disorganized thoughts, memory problems, and difficulties with focus and attention."}
{"prompt": "Someone I care about has a brain injury. Where can I find more information?", "completion": "A brain injury itself isn\u2019t the same as a mental illness, though someone who experiences a brain injury may also experience mental health problems. These mental health problems may stem from the injury itself or from thoughts around the injury (like feelings of loss, anger, or frustration when quality of life changes). In some cases, mental health challenges may not be related to a brain injury at all. The good news is that mental health problems are treatable, even if you or someone you care about has experienced a brain injury. It may be helpful to find a service provider who is familiar with both brain injuries and mental health. \n For more information and support, visit the BC Brain Injury Association. You can also find local and regional groups and organizations in BC through the Brain Injury Association of Canada."}
{"prompt": "What causes mental health problems?", "completion": "Challenges or problems with your mental health can arise from psychological, biological, and social, issues, as well as life events."}
{"prompt": "Someone I love has been diagnosed with depression. How can I help?", "completion": "We naturally want to help a loved one who isn\u2019t feeling well. How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem, but many people say they\u2019re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips: \n You don\u2019t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing, you just need to recognize that it\u2019s a difficult experience. You can try something like, \u201cI can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling unwell.\u201d If you have experienced depression yourself, you might say, \u201cI know how you feel.\u201d Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently, and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness, not comparing symptoms. \n You don\u2019t have to be an expert, but learning more about depression can help you understand what\u2019s going on (and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression). Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start, and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression? \n Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help\u2014in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don\u2019t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. That\u2019s okay! Respect your loved one\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you what they\u2019re ready to talk about. \n Even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can\u2019t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. If you\u2019d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. \n Different people need different things\u2014don\u2019t assume you know what\u2019s best! Some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice. \n When people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It\u2019s a good idea to seek support for yourself\u2014there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness. \n If your loved one isn\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. You can find general advice in the Ask Us section of HeretoHelp. To find local services, call the BC Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us. \n This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)\u2014but you can support them as they work towards recovery. In most cases, your loved one\u2019s treatment and recovery plans are their choice\u2014you are there to offer support and encouragement. \n In order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\u2019t work and will only hurt everyone involved. In most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment you disagree with. It\u2019s important to be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Ask Us: An adult in my life seems ill and won\u2019t find help. What can I do? \n If your loved one says that they have thoughts of ending their life, it\u2019s important to take action. Call 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) at any time or message online at www.crisiscentrechat.ca between noon and 1am. If you think your loved one is in immediate danger, you can always call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room."}
{"prompt": "I\u2019m an adult and I think I might have ADHD. What can I do next?", "completion": "While we think of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as an illness that affects children, it can last into adulthood\u2014and some people aren\u2019t diagnosed until much later in life. \n ADHD is diagnosed like any other mental illness, so your family doctor is a good place to start. Your family doctor may be able to assess your mental health and start treatment, if needed, or they may refer you to more specialized mental health services. \n There are a few organizations that can help you find good resources and find some support: \n The Canadian Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Resource Alliance (CADDRA) is an organization that supports health professionals who research ADHD, treat and support people diagnosed with ADHD, and trains professionals. In the \u2018Public Info\u2019 section of their website, you\u2019ll find more information on adult ADHD and the assessment process. You\u2019ll also find extensive resources and recommended publications. \n The Centre for ADHD Awareness, Canada provides education and advocacy for Canadians who experience ADHD. They have a section on their website for adults, including information on symptoms and assessments, treatments, ADHD in the workplace, resources, and a reading list. \n CHADD Vancouver offers a monthly support group for adults in the Vancouver area."}
{"prompt": "What's the difference between CBT and DBT?", "completion": "CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy) and DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) are two forms of psychotherapy or \u201ctalk therapy.\u201d In both, you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own. \n Cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours influence each other. For example, if you believe that people don\u2019t like you (thought), you might avoid social situations (behaviour) and feel lonely (feeling). However, CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor (changing a thought or behaviour) can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and substance use problems. \n CBT is structured, short-term, goal-oriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next, you\u2019ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem-solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. You\u2019ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future. \n Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT, with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidence-based approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder, and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns, particularly self-harm. \n Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real, and it teaches you how to accept who you are, regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT\u2014including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent check-ins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of one-on-one sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills, you\u2019ll learn skills around managing your emotions, building relationships with others, coping well with problems or distress, acceptance, and mindfulness. \n As with many talk therapies, it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist, they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature\u2014they are tools that last a lifetime."}
{"prompt": "Where can older adults find help for mental health concerns?", "completion": "Mental health concerns are a serious concern at any age, and everyone deserves help and support. If you\u2019re concerned about your mental health, you can: \n Talk to your family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic \n Call the Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) for information about services in your area \n Find your local mental health centre or program at www.gov.bc.ca/mentalhealth (you may need a doctor\u2019s referral to access some programs) \n Find your local Canadian Mental Health Association branch at www.cmha.bc.ca and ask for information about local services \n Contact a local senior\u2019s support organization or group and ask for advice.

They may have a different take on the problem or have different priorities in their health care \n Be patient\u2014it will probably take more than one conversation \n Whenever possible, aim for cooperation. Focus on finding an action or solution that everyone can agree on \n Remember that asking for help is hard for many of us, and it can be even harder as people\u2019s roles and abilities change. If your loved one isn\u2019t willing to talk about their experiences with you right away, offer alternatives like the BC Mental Health Support Line (310-6789\u2014no area code needed), the Seniors Distress Line (604-872-1234) or a local seniors support organization (search for organizations at www.bc211.ca) \n Seek support to manage your expectations and your own well-being. It can be very stressful to see a loved one experience health problems. But adults who can care for themselves and aren\u2019t at risk of harm are free to make their own choices\u2014and that includes refusing help"}

{"prompt": "What's the difference between antidepressants?", "completion": "There are many different types of antidepressant medications, and they each work in different ways. Antidepressants are divided into \u201cclasses\u201d based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain (called neurotransmitters) they are thought to influence. Each class may contain several different medications, which each have slightly different ways of working. Below, you\u2019ll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name. \n SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft) \n SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) \n NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) \n NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant \n SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel) \n There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\u2019t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression\u2014they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\u2019s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It\u2019s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns\u2014or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works."}
{"prompt": "What\u2019s the difference between dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and schizophrenia?", "completion": "Sometimes, people confuse dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Schizophrenia does mean \u201csplit mind,\u201d but the name was meant to describe the \u2018split\u2019 from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person\u2019s sense of themselves. \n Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation\u2014feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they\u2019re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they\u2019ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis. \n Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that aren\u2019t real) and delusions (beliefs that can\u2019t possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions. People who experience schizophrenia may hear or feel things that aren\u2019t real or believe things that can\u2019t be real, but these aren\u2019t separate identities."}
{"prompt": "How can I find a mental health professional right for my child or myself?", "completion": "Feeling comfortable with the professional you or your child is working with is critical to the success of your treatment. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require some research."}
{"prompt": "Where can I learn more information about clinical trials?", "completion": "Sometimes, consumers of mental health services may consider participating in a research study when they have not experienced improvement despite having tried a variety of medications and treatments. Research studies (also known as clinical trials) may involve the use of new medications or new treatment approaches whose safety and effectiveness is being tested. While we support innovation in the field, consumers should be cautioned that there are risks associated with clinical trials \u2013 make sure you\u2019re aware of them before you enroll."}
{"prompt": "If I become involved in treatment, what do I need to know?", "completion": "Since beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families, it can be very overwhelming. It is important to be as involved and engaged in the treatment process as possible. Some questions you will need to have answered include:\nWhat is known about the cause of this particular illness?\nAre there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?\nDo you normally include a physical or neurological examination?\nAre there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?\nWould you advise an independent opinion from another psychiatrist at this point?\nWhat program of treatment is the most helpful with this diagnosis?\nWill this program involve services by other specialists? If so, who will be responsible for coordinating these services?\nWhat do you see as the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in this program of treatment?\nHow much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?\nWhat medications are generally used with this diagnosis?\nHow much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?\nWhat can I do to help you in the treatment?"}
{"prompt": "If I become involved in treatment what do I need to know?", "completion": "Beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families and can be very overwhelming.

{"prompt": "What should I know before starting a new medication?", "completion": "The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:    1. What is the medication supposed to do? 2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective? 3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur? 5. What do I do if a dose is missed? 6. Is there any written information available about this medication? 7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects. Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks."}
{"prompt": "What's the difference between anxiety and stress?", "completion": "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same \u2018fight, flight, or freeze\u2019 response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. \n The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we\u2019re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we\u2019re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. \n Anxiety, on the other hand, isn\u2019t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life."}

{"prompt": "What is the evidence on vaping?", "completion": "\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products. \n The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. \n Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas. \n Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way. \n Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. What this means to you may be a place for talking to start! \n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.
